        What is Chartreuse
      </h4>
      <p>
        Chartreuse is a unique and well-known liqueur that has a rich history dating back to the 18th century. The recipe for Chartreuse was originally created by a group of Carthusian monks in the French Alps. The recipe was said to have been passed down to the monks by a marshal of France, François Annibal d'Estrées, in the early 1700s. The recipe consisted of a secret blend of over 130 herbs, plants, and flowers, and it was said to have medicinal properties.
